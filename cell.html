    <h2>What is a Cell?</h2>
    <p>The cell is the fundamental unit of life. All living organisms ‚Äî from the tiniest bacteria to the largest animals ‚Äî are made up of cells. Some organisms are unicellular (consisting of a single cell), while others, like humans, are multicellular and made of trillions of cells. Every cell performs specific functions essential for the survival of the organism.</p>

    <h2>Discovery of the Cell</h2>
    <p>The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 when he observed a thin slice of cork through a microscope. He saw tiny compartments that resembled a honeycomb and named them "cells." Later scientists like Anton van Leeuwenhoek, Matthias Schleiden, Theodor Schwann, and Rudolf Virchow contributed to developing the cell theory.</p>

    <h2>Cell Theory</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All living organisms are made up of one or more cells.</li>
      <li>The cell is the basic unit of life.</li>
      <li>All cells arise from pre-existing cells.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Cells</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prokaryotic Cells</strong>: These are simple cells without a true nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. Examples: Bacteria, Archaea.</li>
      <li><strong>Eukaryotic Cells</strong>: These are complex cells with a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Examples: Plant cells, Animal cells, Fungi, Protists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Major Parts of an Animal Cell and Their Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cell Membrane</strong>: A protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell.</li>
      <li><strong>Cytoplasm</strong>: Jelly-like fluid where most cellular activities occur.</li>
      <li><strong>Nucleus</strong>: The brain of the cell that contains DNA and controls all activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Nucleolus</strong>: Found inside the nucleus; produces ribosomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitochondria</strong>: Known as the powerhouse of the cell; produces energy (ATP).</li>
      <li><strong>Ribosomes</strong>: Make proteins; found floating in cytoplasm or attached to the rough ER.</li>
      <li><strong>Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)</strong>: Has ribosomes; helps in protein synthesis and transport.</li>
      <li><strong>Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)</strong>: No ribosomes; helps in lipid synthesis and detoxification.</li>
      <li><strong>Golgi Apparatus</strong>: Packages and distributes proteins and lipids within the cell.</li>
      <li><strong>Lysosomes</strong>: Contains enzymes to digest waste materials and old cell parts.</li>
      <li><strong>Centrioles</strong>: Help in cell division.</li>
      <li><strong>Vacuoles</strong>: Store nutrients, waste, and water; smaller in animal cells compared to plant cells.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Difference Between Animal and Plant Cells</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Plant cells have a cell wall; animal cells do not.</li>
      <li>Plant cells have chloroplasts for photosynthesis; animal cells do not.</li>
      <li>Plant cells usually have one large central vacuole; animal cells have many small ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Cells</h2>
    <p>Cells are vital because they carry out all life processes such as respiration, digestion, and reproduction. Specialized cells in multicellular organisms perform specific functions ‚Äî like nerve cells sending signals, blood cells carrying oxygen, and muscle cells helping in movement.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>Did you know? The longest cell in the human body is a motor neuron that can be over 1 meter long!</p>
