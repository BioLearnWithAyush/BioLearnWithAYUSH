    <h2>What is Genetics?</h2>
    <p>Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on how traits and characteristics are inherited from one generation to the next. It explains why we inherit physical features like eye color, height, and hair type from our parents. Genetics helps us understand how living organisms evolve, why diseases run in families, and how to breed plants or animals with specific traits.</p>

    <h2>Key Terms in Genetics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gene:</strong> A small section of DNA that determines a specific trait.</li>
      <li><strong>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):</strong> A molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in growth, development, functioning, and reproduction.</li>
      <li><strong>Chromosome:</strong> Thread-like structures inside the nucleus, made of DNA. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).</li>
      <li><strong>Alleles:</strong> Different forms of the same gene (example: allele for tall and allele for short).</li>
      <li><strong>Genotype:</strong> The genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., TT, Tt, tt).</li>
      <li><strong>Phenotype:</strong> The physical appearance resulting from the genotype (e.g., tall or short).</li>
      <li><strong>Dominant Trait:</strong> A trait that appears in the offspring if at least one dominant allele is present.</li>
      <li><strong>Recessive Trait:</strong> A trait that only appears if both alleles are recessive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gregor Mendel ‚Äì The Father of Genetics</h2>
    <p>Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk who conducted experiments on pea plants in the 1800s. His observations led to the foundation of modern genetics. Mendel studied traits like flower color, seed shape, and plant height, and discovered patterns in how traits are inherited.</p>

    <h3>Mendel‚Äôs Laws:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Law of Dominance:</strong> One allele can mask the expression of another.</li>
      <li><strong>Law of Segregation:</strong> Each parent contributes only one allele for each gene to the offspring.</li>
      <li><strong>Law of Independent Assortment:</strong> Genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Punnett Square</h2>
    <p>A Punnett Square is a tool used to predict the possible genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from a genetic cross. It helps visualize how traits may be inherited. For example, crossing a tall plant (Tt) with a short plant (tt) can produce offspring with either tall or short traits depending on the allele combinations.</p>

    <h2>Applications of Genetics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding and treating genetic disorders.</li>
      <li>Improving crops and livestock through selective breeding.</li>
      <li>Personalized medicine based on genetic makeup.</li>
      <li>Studying evolution and species relationships through genetic data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>Humans share about 60% of their genes with bananas, and 98.8% with chimpanzees!</p>
